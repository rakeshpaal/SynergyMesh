## 📣 Repository Self-Awareness Report

**Identity & Mission**

- **Name**: SynergyMesh – Unmanned Island System
- **Role**: Multi-agent automation platform for intelligent business and
  security orchestration
- **Mission Statement**: Deliver trustworthy automation by combining human
  guardrails with AI-driven execution so that complex cloud operations run
  safely and predictably.

**Current Needs**

- Harden CI/CD workflows (integration-deployment, phase1-integration, and any
  new delegations) to prevent costly reruns.
- Keep TypeScript/ESLint configs consistent across `island-ai`, MCP servers, and
  future workspaces.
- Document operational runbooks for non-CLI teammates (VS Code Tasks, UI
  walk-throughs).
- Maintain agent role definitions so every delegate knows responsibilities and
  limitations before touching the codebase.
- Keep [docs/troubleshooting/INDEX.md](docs/troubleshooting/INDEX.md) and
  [docs/issues/known-failures.md](docs/issues/known-failures.md) current so
  automation alerts map directly to a remediation playbook.

**Guardrails / Anti-Goals**

- Changes that bypass documented governance or security policies.
- Direct edits to production infrastructure without matching runbook entries or approval signals.
- Introducing automation that lacks explainability or overrides human review gates.
- Tooling drift between workspaces (e.g., partially upgraded Node/TypeScript stacks) that would cause Copilot or CI to fail silently.

**Verification Signals**

- ✅ `npm run lint --workspaces --if-present` and
  `npm test --workspaces --if-present` succeed after any tooling change.
- ✅ `.github/workflows/project-self-awareness.yml` posts an up-to-date summary
  on every pull request.
- ✅ Agents listed in `config/agents/team/virtual-experts.yaml` have matching
  docs under `docs/agents/` describing scope and anti-goals.
- ✅ `.github/workflows/project-self-awareness-nightly.yml` raises an issue when
  automation signals fail and links to the troubleshooting index for context.
- ✅ `docs/troubleshooting/INDEX.md` maps every self-awareness signal to the
  appropriate runbook or known-failure entry.
