- Service-level cost attribution
- Team/project cost tracking
- Shared resource allocation
- Chargeback models

### 2. Budget Management

- Team budget allocations
- Monthly/quarterly spending forecasts
- Budget vs. actual tracking
- Overage alerts and policies

### 3. Cost Optimization

- Resource right-sizing recommendations
- Unused resource identification
- Reserved capacity vs. on-demand analysis
- Cost-performance trade-off rules

### 4. Monitoring & Alerts

- Real-time cost tracking
- Anomaly detection
- Budget threshold alerts
- Efficiency trends

### 5. Governance Policies

- Cost tagging standards
- Resource naming conventions
- Approval workflows for new resources
- Shutdown policies for idle resources
