    "needs": [
      "Harden CI/CD workflows (integration-deployment, phase1-integration, and any new delegations) to prevent costly reruns.",
      "Keep TypeScript/ESLint configs consistent across `island-ai`, MCP servers, and future workspaces.",
      "Document operational runbooks for non-CLI teammates (VS Code Tasks, UI walk-throughs).",
      "Maintain agent role definitions so every delegate knows responsibilities and limitations before touching the codebase.",
      "Keep [docs/troubleshooting/INDEX.md](docs/troubleshooting/INDEX.md) and [docs/issues/known-failures.md](docs/issues/known-failures.md) current so automation alerts map directly to a remediation playbook."

    "guardrails": [
      "Changes that bypass documented governance or security policies.",
      "Direct edits to production infrastructure without matching runbook entries or approval signals.",
      "Introducing automation that lacks explainability or overrides human review gates.",
      "Tooling drift between workspaces (e.g., partially upgraded Node/TypeScript stacks) that would cause Copilot or CI to fail silently."

      "\u2705 Agents listed in `config/agents/team/virtual-experts.yaml` have matching docs under `docs/agents/` describing scope and anti-goals.",
      "\u2705 `.github/workflows/project-self-awareness-nightly.yml` raises an issue when automation signals fail and links to the troubleshooting index for context.",
      "\u2705 `docs/troubleshooting/INDEX.md` maps every self-awareness signal to the appropriate runbook or known-failure entry."
